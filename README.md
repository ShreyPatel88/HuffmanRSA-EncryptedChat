#Double Encryption using RSA and Huffman Algorithm

## Description
A client-server application that implements double encryption using RSA and Huffman algorithms to secure messages and prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. The client converts messages into an ASCII value and applies double encryption with RSA and Huffman. The encrypted message is then sent to the receiving client who can then decrypt the encoded message.

## Features
- Dual encryption with RSA and Huffman algorithms
- ASCII conversion of messages
- Compression of encrypted messages
- Decryption of encoded messages

## Technical Details
The project is written in Java version 11 and uses built-in functions with the Java Framework. 

## Requirements
- Java version 11 or higher
- A Java IDE for development and execution
